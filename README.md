# digit_recognizer
We used MNIST dataset that consist 60,000 images of handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) out of which 40,000 images are used to train 
our CNN model and 20,000 for testing on google colab GPU.
The resultant accuracy of this model is 0.989 which can be further increased with some tuning.
